# A Statistical Study on Diabetes Using Logistic Regression

## Overview

This repository contains my **B.Sc. Statistics dissertation project**, submitted to
**St. Xavier’s College (Autonomous), Kolkata**, under the supervision of **Prof. Madhura Dasgupta**.

The study investigates the presence of diabetes using **binary logistic regression**, based on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, with emphasis on statistical modeling, inference, and interpretation.

## Project Description

The objective of this project is to identify and analyze key factors influencing diabetes status. The analysis includes exploratory data visualization, categorical data analysis, assessment of multicollinearity, fitting of a binary logistic regression model, hypothesis testing of predictors, and evaluation of model performance.

All **results, tables, and visualizations** are presented and discussed within the project report.
